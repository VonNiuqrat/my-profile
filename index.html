	 <h2>Video Games</h2>
	 <p>
	 I loves Videogames, I pretty much play everytime i can. It can go from completing 100% the Arkham serie again even if i already know all of them by heart to play Cyberpunk 2077 all night because i cant stop. I love it.

	 <h2>Sports</h2>
	 <p>
	 I do a lot of sports, I go to the gym 5 times a week alone or with friends, but i also do muay thaï, which is thaï boxing. It's a type of boxing where you also use elbows, knee and chin in addition to your fists and feets. It's very brutal and harsh but it's an incredible sport.

	 <h2>Cinema</h2>
	 <p>
	 I love movies, i tried to find my favorite movie of all time but was having a hard time finding it so if i had to choose 3 of them i would say ready player on because it's a great movie but also because there's litteraly references of other movies in each frame, fight club, i don't think there is anything to say. And finally the original Pacific Rim, a bit of a guilty pleasure but big robots against big monster, of course it's incredible.
